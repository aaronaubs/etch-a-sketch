Etch-A-Sketch Project through TOP

This project is part of the Foundations path of The Odin Project. The task is to create an etch-a-sketch board that changes the background color of a grid of squares when hovered over by the mouse. However, I'm going to do my best to make some adjustments to the project to make the UI more practical and user-friendly.
